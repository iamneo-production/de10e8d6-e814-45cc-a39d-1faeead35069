        A task management portal, also known as a task management system or software, is a digital platform that helps individuals or teams organize and track their tasks, projects, and workflows. It provides a centralized location for creating, assigning, prioritizing, and monitoring tasks, ensuring efficient collaboration and productivity.

Key features of a task management portal may include:

Users can create tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, and add relevant details such as descriptions, attachments, and dependencies.

Tasks can be assigned to specific team members or groups, allowing for clear responsibility and accountability.

Prioritization:Users can prioritize tasks based on their urgency or importance and set deadlines to ensure timely completion.

Progress Tracking: The portal enables tracking the progress of tasks, showing their status (e.g., not started, in progress, completed), estimated time remaining, and any associated comments or updates.
